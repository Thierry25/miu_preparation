Define an m-n sequenced array to be an array that contains one or more occurrences of all the integers between m and n inclusive. Furthermore, the array must be in ascending order and contain only those integers.
For example, {2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5} is a 2-5 sequenced array. The array {2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5} is not a 2-5 sequenced array because it is missing a 4. The array {0, 2, 2, 3, 3} is not a 2-3 sequenced array because the 0 is out of range.
 And {1,1, 3, 2, 2, 4} is not a 1-4 sequenced array because it is not in ascending order.
