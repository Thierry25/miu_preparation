The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every natural number greater than 1 can be written as a unique product of prime numbers.
 So, for instance, 6936=2*2*2*3*17*17. Write a method named encodeNumber what will encode a number n as an array that contains the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, will equal n.
 So encodeNumber(6936) would return the array {2, 2, 2, 3, 17, 17}. If the number is <= 1 the function should return null;
